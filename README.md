# jenkins-pytrhon-code

Here is a Python script that will prompt the user to enter the values for these environment variables and then store them using the os.environ dictionary.

This script will prompt the user to enter the values for each environment variable, and will use the os.environ dictionary To set them. 

The input() function is used to prompt the user for input, and the or operator is used to provide a default value for the GITHUB_URL variable if the user does not enter a value.

To use this script, you would run it in your terminal or command prompt, and follow the prompts to enter the values for each environment variable. 

Once the script has completed, you can then run your Jenkins automation script, which will load the environment variables using os.environ.get().
